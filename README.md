# What does this script do? 
This script installs vscode and the extensions that I prefer for development, aswell as changes my settings.json for me.

# What os does it run on?
This script was written for arch linux, but it would be very easy to make it work on debian or other distros. (Swap sudo pacman -S code with whatever package manager your os uses)

# Prerequisites
You must be logged into git via the terminal.
